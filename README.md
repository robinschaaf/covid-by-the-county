# covid-by-the-county

###Hybrid app that allows users to subscribe to push notifications for covid case and death counts by county and also view county historical data###


To run, Ionic CLI needs to be installed:
https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/your-first-app

Once that is done:
To install, run `npm install`
To test and develop in a browser, run `ionic serve`

Once updates are made, to update for iOS:
run `ionic build`
run `npx cap copy ios`
The workspace can now be opened in xcode like a normal iOS app.
